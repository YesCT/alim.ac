On January 26 I participated in [Drupal Global Sprint Weekend][]. READMORE This was my second time participating in a sprint during the Global Sprint Days (listen to this [podcast with Cathy Theys][] to find out how it all got started). Here are a few things that made this sprint experience even better than the last:

1. I had a specific goal.
2. My local environment was already set up.
3. I read [A Helpful Guide to Your First Drupal Sprint][].

My goal was to learn more about configuration management in Drupal 8. I actually didn't get to exploring configuration management, but I learned about using [drush][] for automating installation and tear-down of a Drupal site. 

My stack is OS X 10.8.5 and MAMP 2.1.2. In the future I hope to use vagrant, but I think that MAMP is an easy tool to start with.
